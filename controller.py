Letssay the game wants to move items from x to y
to use item x on slot y
drag(posX, posY)
We could just be given item and 
Should we just make it

I guess we could give all the controls even though
our bot wouldn't be using it all but maybe in the future?
But how deep should they be?
Should we just have it input by position or by a unit type?
I think just position should be fine and have the bot handle 
the whole thing?
