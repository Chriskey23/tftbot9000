TFTBot to play Teamfight Tactics  
Uses pyautogui to control TFT and play automatically  
Yeah, none of this works :(  
Getting state is a pain  
Current code is incomplete, still figuring out how to get and manage all the state.  
Shelved for now, will return sometime in set 6.  
Probably going to go and make an image recognition network for obtaining game state.  
Might look into faster screenshoting or alternative direction for carousel
